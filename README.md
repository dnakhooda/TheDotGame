<h1>ðŸ”´ The Dot Game ðŸ”µ</h1>

<p>
The Dot Game is a simple 2D web game where your objective is to reach the goal on the right side of the screen. To get there, you must avoid red obstacles. If you touch one, you'll be sent back to the beginning of the level. Reach the goal, and you'll advance to the next level with even more challenging obstacles.
